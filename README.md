# Assignment 7: Author Identification <br>

## Short Description:<br>
This program makes use of k-nearest neighbors algorithm in order to compute the distance in terms of difference beteween two pieces of texts. It makes use of a bloomfilter and a hashtable to store words from a file and enable the ability for the words to be searched up. 

## Build:<br>
A Makefile is provided and can be used to build the program. This can be accomplished within the directory where the program files are located by typing any of these commands: 'make', 'make all', 'make identify'. The command 'make format' will format all of the source code along with the header files. 

## Running:<br>
The format for running **identify**: (./identify **-d 'Path to database'** **-n 'Path to file of noise words'** **-k 'Number of matches'** **-l 'Number of noise words to filter'** **-e 'Set to Euclidean distance'** **-m 'Set to Manhattan distance;** **-c 'Set to Cosine distance'** **-h 'Help/Usage(OPTIONAL)'**) <br>


### 'Input Commands' <br>
**identify**<br>
-d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Path to database of authors and texts (default: lib.db) <br>
-n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Path to file of noise words to filter out (default: noise.txt) <br>
-k&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of matches (default: 5) <br>
-l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of noise words to filter out (default: 100) <br>
-e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Euclidean distance metric (default metric)<br>
-m&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manhattan distance metric <br>
-c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosine distance metric <br>
-h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display program help and usage <br>

## Cleaning: <br>
To remove all files that were generated by the compiler, type the command 'make cleanâ€™.
